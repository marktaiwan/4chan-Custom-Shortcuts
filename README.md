# 4chan Custom Shortcuts

My [Derpibooru Custom Shortcuts](https://github.com/marktaiwan/Derpibooru-Custom-Shortcuts) ported to work with 4chan. Follow the link for usage details. One notable difference is that native shortcuts are not disabled if their keybinds aren't used by the script. This is done because I didn't want to reimplement every shortcut (e.g. open quick reply).

## Install
An userscript manager such as [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) is required.
